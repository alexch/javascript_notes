# JavaScript Basics

"In JavaScript, there is a beautiful, elegant, highly expressive language that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders."
 - Douglas Crockford, JavaScript: The Good Parts
 
# Types

(todo: overview of basic types in JS)

# Objects

* JS Object = Hash = Map = Dictionary
* Keys are converted into strings 

# Properties

* Properties are values stored on an object
* Accessed two ways:
  1. dot `user.name`
  2. bracket `user['name']`

# Arrays

## Looping over the elements of an array

The normal way:
 
    for (var i = 0; i<a.length; ++i) { ... }

In old implementations, the above suffers from a performance problem, so you may see the following recommended instead:

    for (var i = 0, n = a.length; i<n; ++i) { ... }

# Equality

* `==` performs **type coercion**
* this leads to some improbable results

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1724255/why-does-2-2-in-javascript

    2 == [2] // true

evaluates as 

    2 === Number([2].valueOf().toString())

# More equality madness

    @@@ javascript
    ""           ==   "0"           // false
    0            ==   ""            // true
    0            ==   "0"           // true
    false        ==   "false"       // false
    false        ==   "0"           // true
    false        ==   undefined     // false
    false        ==   null          // false
    null         ==   undefined     // true
    " \t\r\n"    ==   0             // true

## Moral: always use === (triple equal)
