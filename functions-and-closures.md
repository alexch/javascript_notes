# Functions

http://kangax.github.com/nfe/ - Named function expressions demystified / Function expressions vs. Function declarations

A few ways to define a function:

## Function Declaration aka Named Function
    function add(x,y) { return x + y; }
  not recommended (why not?)
  
## Function Expression
    var subtract = function(x,y) { return x - y; }

## Named Function Expression
    var factorial = function fact(x) { 
      if (x == 1) {
        return 1;
      } else {
        return x * (fact(x-1));
      }
    }
  useful only for debugging [and recursion?]

## Method 

    var student = {
        gpa: 4.0,
        grade: function() {
            var gradeLetters = ["F", "D", "C", "B", "A"];
            return gradeLetters[Math.floor(this.gpa)];
        }
    };
    // or...
    student.grade = function() { ... }

# Methods

A method is a function "on" an object
When a method is called via the dot operator, the "this" variable points to the object it was called on
Technical definition of object:
  An object encapsulates state and behavior
  state = properties
  behavior = methods
  
    var alice = {firstName: 'Alice', lastName: 'Liddell'};
    var bob = {firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Jones'};
    alice.fullName = function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; }
    bob.fullName = alice.fullName;  // Whoa, trippy!
    alice.fullName(); //=> "Alice Liddell"
    bob.fullName(); //=> "Bob Jones"

# Closures

"lexical scope" vs. "[compiled?] scope"
